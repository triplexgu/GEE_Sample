# Exercise: Google Earth Engine World Mosaic

## Your task
Back in [1991](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Billion_Dollar_Code), a World Image Mosaic was, as any mosaic, an art piece. Your task is to recreate that piece of art, using a billion dollar code, i.e. Earth Engine.

You are asked to create a cloud-free world mosaic, using any satellite constellation. Decorate as you please. In the end, you can push yourself and make an app out of it.

## Requirements
- Task 1: Use level 2 imagery (surface reflectance) to create a mosaic in Google Earth Engine. The mosaic should look realistic (Google Earth like). Don't worry if you're not covering the entire world. Use any time period you want.

- Task 2: Mask clouds.

- Task 3: Write and use at least 1 function.

- Project structure:
    - Write the script in Google Earth Engine's [code editor](https://code.earthengine.google.com/). Copy paste the code from the code editor into a text file so that you can submit it in your git repository.
    - Write your names, project name, license, etc in the header of your script.
    - Write the link (Get Link) in the header of your final submission script.
